				<li>Feedback from Ashley:</li>
					<p>
						1. the yellow bars could be below the photos.(they are bit distracting to the photos themselves)
						<br>
						2. make sure to have space between each steps so that each step would be more distinctly identifiable.
						<br>
						3. seems a bit jam packed, so consider your spacings for everything.
						<br>
						4.  The color scheme works well with the photo and the theme.

					<p>1. The big image on very top of the page can be cropped. Because the outfocused part of the image takes half of the image, it is kind of distracting.
					<br>
					2. More gap between the ‘banana bread’ title and ‘ingredients.’
					<br>
					3. Overall size of the font for ingredients and instructions are too small. Make it bigger. 
					<br>
					4. The line height for ingredients needs to be bigger. It is hard to distinguish each ingredient. Same for instructions. (especially instruction 7, 8, and 9 are too hard to distinguish.)
