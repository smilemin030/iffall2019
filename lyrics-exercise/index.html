If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,<br>
I'll sail the world to find you<br>
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,<br>
I'll be the light to guide you<br>
Find out what we're made of<br>
When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
You can count on me like one two three<br>
I'll be there<br>
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two<br>
You'll be there<br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
Whoa, whoa<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep<br>
I'll sing a song<br>
Beside you<br>
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me<br>
Everyday I will<br>
Remind you<br>
Ooh<br>
Find out what we're made of<br>
When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
You can count on me like one two three<br>
I'll be there<br>
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two<br>
You'll be there<br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry<br>
I'll never let go<br>
Never say goodbye<br>
You know you can<br>
Count on me like one two three<br>
I'll be there<br>
And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two<br>
And you'll be there<br>
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah<br>
Oh, oh<br>
You can count on me 'cause I can count on you<br>
