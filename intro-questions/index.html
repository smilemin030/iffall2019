				<li>Q: What made me join this class?
					<p>
						A: This class was one of the major courses that I had to take as a Communication Design major, yet I am really thrilled to take this course because I believe that it is really crucial to know how to create a website and learn how the website I create can interact with the viewers.

				<li>Q: Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
					<p>
						
						A: One way I see the difference between designing for screen and designing for paper is that for designing screen, I am not the one creating the work, but I order the computer what to do and the computer does the work istead of me.

				<li> Q: Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
					<p>
						A: I believe that the apple website did a great job of creating effective design for screen. Link: 
						<a href= "https://www.apple.com"> Apple</a> <br>
						Apple grouped thier products and displaying on the menu on the top of the website, people can easily find where to go see the product. The design of the website is minimalised and used grid to create a clean and clear delivery. Last but not least the design of the website provides a sense of its brand image.

				<li> Q: Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice
					<p>
						A: I found that the google website shows an example of the effective communication. Link: 
						<a href= "https://www.google.com"> Google</a> <br>
						When the viewer search a topic on the main title, Google brings and provides a variety of information from a lot of different sources in one page where the users can easily click and get resources in short amount of time. 
					</p>

				<li>Q: Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.
					<p>
						A: There are many ways of defining "works well." I choose the Linkedin Website as an example that works well for following reasons. Link: 
						<a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/"> Linkedin</a> <br>
						Different from other social media website, Linkedin has a clear purpose in terms of networking. Because people can easily search and reach out to people in Linkedin, Linkedin profiles become an alternative way of the users' resume. The posts that are made in Linkedin shows or implies who the user is, which helps the user to market themselves to the companies or people who might be intereseted in their career or network. Because of its effective display and interactive design that support their purpose of the website: networking, I choosed Linkedin as a website that works well.
